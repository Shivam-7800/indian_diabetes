Diabetes is a significant health concern in India, with the country being labeled as the "diabetes capital of the world." There are several reasons for this high prevalence, including genetic predisposition, sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy dietary habits, and rapid urbanization leading to changes in lifestyle.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form in India, and it is closely linked to obesity and lack of physical activity. Furthermore, Indians tend to develop diabetes at a younger age and at a lower body mass index compared to other ethnic groups.

Addressing the diabetes epidemic in India requires a comprehensive approach involving public health initiatives, education on healthy lifestyle habits, access to healthcare services, and affordable treatment options. Additionally, there's a growing emphasis on early detection and prevention strategies to curb the rising prevalence of diabetes and its associated complications.
